You are trying to verify how factual a response to a question or request is. To do so, you need to break down a sentence and extract as many fine-grained facts mentioned in the response. Each of these fine-grained facts should be verifiable against reliable external world knowledge (e.g., via Wikipedia). Any story, personal experiences, hypotheticals (e.g., "would be" or subjunctive), subjective statements (e.g., opinions), suggestions, advice, instructions, and other such content should not be included in the list. Biographical, historical, scientific, and other such texts are not personal experiences or  stories. You should extract verifiable facts from them. Each fact should also be describing either one single event (e.g., "Nvidia is founded in 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, U.S.") or single state (e.g., "UMass Amherst has existed for 161 years.") with necessary time and location information. Quotations should be extracted verbatim with the source when available. Listed references should be ignored.

Extract fine-grained facts from the sentence between <SOS> and <EOS>. You should focus on the named entities and numbers in the sentence and extract relevant information from the sentence. Do not extract claims from the question. The question and other sentences are only context for you to recover pronouns, definite phrases (e.g., "the victims" or "the pope"), and so on. Each fact should be understandable on its own and require no additional context. This means that you need to always related the extracted claims to the question. This also means that all entities must be referred to by name but not pronoun. Use the name of entities rather than definite noun phrases (e.g., 'the teacher') whenever possible. If a definite noun phrase is used, be sure to add modifiers (e.g., a embedded clause, a prepositional phrase, etc.). Each fact must be situated within relevant temporal and location whenever needed. Keep each fact to one sentence with zero or at most one embedded clause. You do not need to justify what you extract.

If there is no verifiable fact in the sentence, please write "No verifiable claim."

Question: How come the Netherlands managed to pull their weight versus Europe's superpowers with a population of a measly 1.5 million?
The trading empire of the Dutch Republic would be impressive alone for it's achievements in trade and warfare, but it's astounding when you realize that by 1600, the Netherlands had 1.5m for population! Compare that to 18m of France, or 9m approx of Spain, or 5.6m by England.
I get that they were very sophisticated and had advanced commerce, production and politics. But still... 1.5 million? How is that enough manpower to arm enough soldiers on land to prevent invasions, and sailors to operate a huge fleet? And given the immense wealth and manpower of Spain and Portugal compared to that of the Dutch - what prevented them from just dropping in on Amsterdam and burn it so to keep them out of their business? Or maybe drop in on Calais and march on land if they didn't have enough naval power.

Question: How did diarrhea kill so many people before and now it’s not that big of a deal?
Title really, is it just that our diet is better and decent food is much more abundant or is it just general hygiene?
Response: A lot of illnesses with high mortality rates that diarrhea is a symptom of are better treated today and are less common.

Today, cholera is very rare since the public water supply is much more cleaner and less prone to contamination by disease. If someone does contract cholera, there are much more advanced medical treatment available that make the mortality rate &lt;1% if you seek treatment.
